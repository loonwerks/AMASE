      Tools developed under the AMASE project: 
         The Safety Annex for the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) 
         provides the ability to reason about faults and faulty component behaviors in AADL models. 
         In the Safety Annex approach, we use formal assume-guarantee contracts to define the 
         nominal behavior of system components. The nominal model is then verified using the 
         Assume Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE). The Safety Annex provides a way to 
         weave faults into the nominal system model and analyze the behavior of the system in 
         the presence of faults. The Safety Annex also provides a library of common fault node 
         definitions that is customizable to the needs of system and safety engineers.
