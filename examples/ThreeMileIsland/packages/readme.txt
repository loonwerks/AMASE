ThreeMileIsland is based on the NuSMV model from Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systems.
That NuSMV model is a simplified version of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) accident from 1979.

The electricity is generated using two hydraulic circuits that transfer the heat produced
by the nuclear reaction to a turbine. The coolant used is water. 

Primary circuit: the water is in direct contact with the nuclear material (fuel) from here on. 
The coolant is highly pressurized so it remains in liquid form. 
Primary circuit functions are:
 - Keep reaction under control
 - Transfer the hear generated by the fuel to the coolant of the secondary circuit through steam generator.
