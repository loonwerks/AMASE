\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
Starting from the error model notions of error types, two main faults were defined: \textit{fail\_to} which will describe errors of valves and pressure regulators and \textit{inverted\_fail} which describes the faults occurring to components that output boolean values. Using the AADL behavioral model of the WBS, these permanent errors were tied into the nominal model in order to reason about how this model behaves in the presence of specific kinds of faults. What was seen is that the model does fulfill the top level contract even when a permanent fault of one of these two types is introduced.
