\section{Conclusion}

We have developed a way to leverage recent research in model checking techniques in order to generate minimal cut sets in a compositional fashion. Using the idea of Inductive Validity Cores (IVCs), which are the minimal model elements necessary for a proof of a safety property, we are able to restate the safety property as a top level event and provide the model elements as faults of components and their contracts. The JKind model checker then uses the faults and contracts as model elements and returns all minimal IVC elements. These are used to generate a fault tree, a fault propagation diagram, and complete calculations such as TLE occurrance probability. Future work includes...
