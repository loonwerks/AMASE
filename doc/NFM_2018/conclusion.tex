\section{Conclusion}

We have developed an extension to the AADL language with tool support for formal analysis of system safety properties in the presence of faults. Nominal and faulty behaviors are specified separately, so that safety analysis and system implementation can be driven from a common model. This new Safety Annex leverages the AADL structural model and nominal behavioral specification (using the AGREE annex) to propagate faulty component behaviors without the need to add separate propagation specifications to the model.   Next steps will include implementation of preprocessing for probabilistic fault thresholds, extensions to automate injection of Byzantine faults, and support for more of the AADL and AGREE syntax.
