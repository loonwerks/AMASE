The Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL)
\cite{FeilerModelBasedEngineering2012} is an SAE International standard \cite{AADL_Standard} that defines a language and provides a unifying framework for describing the system architecture for ``performance-critical, embedded, real-time systems'' \cite{AADL_Standard}. An AADL model describes a system in terms of a hierarchy of components and their interconnections, where each component can either represent a logical entity (e.g., application software functions, data) or a physical entity (e.g., buses, processors). An AADL model can be associated with properties and be extended with language annexes to provide a richer set of modeling elements for various system design and analysis needs (e.g., performance-related characteristics, configuration settings, dynamic behaviors). The language semantics supports formal analysis tools that allow for early phase error/defect detection.

Talk about AGREE

Following the motivation/discussion in the process subsection, talk about why we choose to extend AGREE in safety annex, instead of using a separate safety model, or a semi-separate safety model like EMV2.


The Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL)
\cite{FeilerModelBasedEngineering2012} is a architecture modeling language for embedded,
real-time, distributed systems. It was approved as an SAE Standard in 2004, and
its standardization committee has active participation from many academic and
industrial partners in the aerospace industry. It provides the constructs needed
to model both hardware and software in embedded systems such as threads, processes, processors, buses, and memory. It is sufficiently formal for our purposes,
and is extensible through the use of language annexes that can initiate calls to
separately developed analysis tools.


A model described in AADL consists of
a number of components and connections. Components are typical
constructs that appear in embedded systems. Components can represent
hardware constructs (e.g., processors, buses, memories) or software
constructs (e.g., processes, threads, subprograms). The language
distinguishes between component types and implementations. A component
type describes the component's interface (e.g., inputs, outputs) as
well as other component specific properties. A component
implementation describes the subcomponents and connections that
implement this interface.


The Assume Guarantee Reasoning
Environment (AGREE) \cite{Cofer12:comp-verif} 
is a language and tool for compositional verification of AADL models.  It is implemented as an AADL annex
that allows AADL models to be annotated with  assume-guarantee behavioral contracts.  
A contract contains a set of assumptions about the component's
inputs and a set of guarantees about the component's outputs. The assumptions
and guarantees may also contain predicates that reason about how the state of
a component evolves over time.

AGREE uses a syntax similar to Lustre \cite{Lustre-91} to express a contract's assumptions
and guarantees. AGREE translates an AADL model and its contract annotations
into Lustre and then queries a user-selected model checker to perform verification.
The goal of the analysis is to prove that each component's contract
is satisfied by the interaction of its direct subcomponents as
described by their respective contracts. Verification is performed at each
layer of the architecture hierarchy and details of lower level
components are abstracted away during verification of higher level
component contracts.  This compositional approach allows large systems to be analyzed efficiently.  

Component contracts at the lowest level of the
architecture are assumed to be true by AGREE. Verification of these
component contracts must be performed outside of the AADL/AGREE environment.  
In a traditional software development process, components will be developed to meet
the high-level requirements corresponding to these contracts and verified by testing or code review.
However, there are two problems with this approach:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Verification methodologies like test and code review are not exhaustive. 
	Errors in these activities can cause the compositional verification that 
	AGREE performs to be incorrect.
	\item Manual translation of an AGREE contract into a property for verification at the component level can be
	time-consuming and error-prone.
	%There may be errors in the translation of the AGREE contract from the 
	%properties that were proved from component level verification activities.
\end{enumerate}

Our solution to these problems is to automatically translate AGREE
contracts of software components into
expressions in the development language of the component software. A formal
verification tool that reasons about artifacts expressed in this
language can then be used to verify that the contracts hold. 
The remainder of the paper describes this solution in detail.
