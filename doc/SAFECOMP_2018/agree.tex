\subsection{Architecture Description and Design Contracts}
\label{subsec:aadl-agree}

%Pull AADL/AGREE background from previous papers to support points in the safety process
%Talk about AADL, AGREE, and why safety annex
The Architecture Analysis and Design Language(AADL) [ref AADL] is an architecture modeling language %borrow wording from liu-backes-cofer-gacek-NFM2016 paper 

It comes with associated annexes and tool extensions (see Section) in the Open Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE) and allows for a wide range of system modeling and analysis capabilities (e.g., latency, throughput, behaviors). 

Talk about AGREE

Following the motivation/discussion in the process subsection, talk about why we choose to extend AGREE in safety annex, instead of using a separate safety model, or a semi-separate safety model like EMV2.
