\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
System safety analysis techniques are well-established and are a required activity in the development of safety-critical systems. While model based development methods are widely used in the aerospace industry, these methods are only recently being applied to system safety analysis. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods and tools based on formal methods now permit system-level requirements to be specified and analyzed early in the development process~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu,CAV2015:BoCiGrMa}. These tools can also be used to perform safety analysis based on the system architecture and initial functional decomposition. Design models can be integrated into the safety analysis process to help guarantee accurate and consistent results. This integration is especially important as the amount of safety-critical hardware and software in various domains has drastically increased due to the demand for greater autonomy, capability, and connectedness.

We have developed a Safety Annex for the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)~\cite{FeilerModelBasedEngineering2012} that provides the ability to reason about faults and faulty component behaviors in AADL models. In the Safety Annex approach, we use formal assume-guarantee contracts to define the nominal behavior of system components. The nominal model is then verified using the Assume Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE)~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}. The Safety Annex  provides a way to weave faults into the nominal system model and analyze the behavior of the system in the presence of faults. The Safety Annex also provides a library of common fault node definitions that is customizable to the needs of system and safety engineers.

There are other tools purpose-built for safety analysis, including AltaRica~\cite{PROSVIRNOVA2013127}, smartIFlow~\cite{info8010007} and xSAP~\cite{DBLP:conf/tacas/BittnerBCCGGMMZ16}. These notations are separate from the system development model. Other tools extend existing system models, such as HiP-HOPS~\cite{CHEN201391} and the AADL Error Model Annex, Version 2 (EMV2)~\cite{EMV2}. EMV2 uses enumeration of faults in each component and explicit propagation of faulty behavior to perform error analysis. The required propagation relationships must be manually added to the system model and can become complex, leading to mistakes in the analysis.

In contrast, the Safety Annex supports model checking and quantitative reasoning by attaching behavioral faults to components and then using the normal behavioral propagation and proof mechanisms built into the AGREE AADL annex.  This allows users to reason about the evolution of faults over time, and produce counterexamples demonstrating how component faults lead to failures.
Our approach adapts the work of Joshi et. al in
~\cite{Joshi05:Dasc} to the AADL modeling language.  More information on the approach is available in~\cite{Stewart17:IMBSA}, and the tool and relevant documentation can be found at: \small \url{https://github.com/loonwerks/AMASE/}. \normalsize
