\section{Architecture and Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

The Safety Annex is written in Java as a plug-in for the OSATE AADL toolset, which is built on Eclipse.  It is not designed as a stand-alone extension of the language, but works with behavioral contracts specified in AGREE AADL annex~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}. 
The architecture of the Safety Annex is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plugin-arch}.

 %AGREE allows {\em assume-guarantee} behavioral contracts to be added to AADL components.  The language used for contract specification is based on the Lustre dataflow language~\cite{Halbwachs91:IEEE}. %AGREE improves scalability of formal verification to large systems by decomposing the analysis of a complex system architecture into a collection of smaller verification tasks that correspond to the structure of the architecture.

AGREE contracts are used to define the nominal behaviors of system components as {\em guarantees} that hold when {\em assumptions} about the values the component's environment are met.  The Safety Annex extends these contracts to allow faults to modify the behavior of component inputs and outputs. 
% To support these extensions, AGREE implements an Eclipse extension point interface that allows other plug-ins to modify the generated abstract syntax tree (AST) prior to its submission to the solver.  If the Safety Annex is enabled, these faults are added to the AGREE contract and, when triggered, override the nominal guarantees provided by the component.  
An example of a portion of an initial AGREE node and its extended contract is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lustre}. The left column of the figure shows the nominal Lustre pump definition is shown with an AGREE contract on the output; and the right column shows the additional local variables for the fault (boxes 1 and 2), the assertion binding the fault value to the nominal value (boxes 3 and 4), and the fault node definition (box 5).

%In the left column of the figure, the nominal Lustre pump definition is shown with an AGREE contract on the output. In the right column, the additional local variables for the fault are seen in boxes 1 and 2, the assertion binding the fault value to the nominal value is seen in boxes 3 and 4, and the fault node definition is given in box 5. 

Once augmented with fault information, the AGREE model follows the standard translation path to the model checker JKind~\cite{2017arXiv171201222G}, an infinite-state model checker for safety properties.  The augmentation includes traceability information so that when counterexamples are displayed to users, the active faults for each component are visualized.

AGREE contracts are used to define the nominal behaviors of system components as {\em guarantees} that hold when {\em assumptions} about the values the component's environment are met.  The Safety Annex extends these contracts to allow faults to modify the behavior of component inputs and outputs.  To support these extensions, AGREE implements an Eclipse extension point interface that allows other plug-ins to modify the generated abstract syntax tree (AST) prior to its submission to the solver.  If the Safety Annex is enabled, these faults are added to the AGREE contract and, when triggered, override the nominal guarantees provided by the component.  

An example of a portion of an initial AGREE node and its extended contract is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lustre}.  %The \texttt{\_\_fault} variables and declarations are added to allow the contract to override the nominal behavioral constraints (provided by guarantees) on outputs.  In the Lustre language, \texttt{assertion}s are constraints that are assumed to hold in the transition system. 
In the left column of the figure, the nominal Lustre pump definition is shown with an AGREE contract on the output. In the right column, the additional local variables for the fault are seen in boxes 1 and 2, the assertion binding the fault value to the nominal value is seen in boxes 3 and 4, and the fault node definition is given in box 5. 

%A  benefit of utilizing the AGREE behavioral annex is the ability to perform both monolithic and compositional analysis on the nominal model. AGREE allows {\em assume-guarantee} behavioral contracts to be added to AADL components.  The language used for contract specification is based on the Lustre dataflow language~\cite{Halbwachs91:IEEE} and the nominal model (AADL model annotated with AGREE contracts) is translated into Lustre before being sent to the JKind model checker for verification\cite{2017arXiv171201222G}. 

%When a user selects to run the fault analysis during verification, the AGREE contracts are automatically extended in Lustre in order to allow faults to modify the behavior of component outputs. These injections into the Lustre model are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lustre}.

%An annotation in the AADL model determines the fault hypothesis.  This may specify either a maximum number of faults that can be active at any point in execution (typically one or two), or that only faults whose probability of simultaneous occurrence is above some probability threshold should be considered. In the former case, we assert that the sum of the true {\em fault\_\_trigger} variables is below some integer threshold.  In the latter, we determine all combinations of faults whose probabilities are above the specified probability threshold, and describe this as a proposition over {\em fault\_\_trigger} variables.
%
%With the introduction of dependent faults, active faults are divided into two categories: independently active (activated by its own triggering event) and dependently active (activated when the faults they depend on become active). The top level fault hypothesis applies to independently active faults. Faulty behaviors augment nominal behaviors whenever their corresponding faults are active (either independently active or dependently active).

%Once augmented with fault information, the AGREE model follows the standard translation path to the model checker JKind~\cite{2017arXiv171201222G}, an infinite-state model checker for safety properties.  The augmentation includes traceability information so that when counterexamples are displayed to users, the active faults for each component are visualized.


%For fault analysis, we separate the possible analyses available to users into two distinct actions and describe them here.
