\subsection{Transformation of MCS} 


%\begin{theorem} 
\underline{Theorem}: The MinCutSet can be generated by transformation of the MCS.\\

%\begin{proof} 

\textit{Proof}: For faults in the model $F$ and subcomponent contracts $G$:\\ $MCS \cap F \neq \{\}$ $\lor$ $MCS \cap G \neq \{\}$.\\

\underline{Part 1}: $MCS \cap G = \{\}$ (Leaf level of system)\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

\item MCS $\subseteq$ MinCutSet: \\

Let $M \in  MCS$. Then $C\setminus M$ is SAT. Since $!\exists g \in C$ for $g \in G$, thus $M \subseteq F$ and is a cut set.  \\

By minimality of the $MCS$, $M$ is a minimal cut set for $ \neg P $.  \\

\item $MinCutSet $ $\subseteq$ MCS: \\

Let $M \in MinCutSet$. Then all faults in $M$ cause $ \neg P $ to occur by definition. Thus, $C\setminus M$ is SAT.  \\

By minimality of $MinCutSet$, $M$ is also minimal and thus is a minimal correction set.\\

\end{enumerate}

\underline{Part 2}: $MCS \cap G \neq \{\}$ (Intermediate level of system)\\

Assume $\overline{C} = \{F,G,P\}$ with the constraints that all $f \in F$ are inactive and all $g\in G$ are valid with regard to top level property $P$, i.e. the nominal model proves. \\

Let $MCS = \{f_1,...,f_n,g_1,...,g_m\}$

For $g_1 \in MCS$, $\exists F_1 \subseteq F$ where $F_1$ is a minimal set of active faults that cause the violation of $g_1$.  Replace $g_1$ in $MCS$ with $F_1$. Then $MCS = \{f_1,...,f_n, F_1,g_2,...,g_m\}$. \\

Perform this replacement for all $g_i \in MCS$ until we reach $MCS = \{f_1,...,f_n,F_1,...,F_m\}$. \\

Since $F_i$ is minimal, the $MCS$ retains its minimality. Furthermore $MCS \subseteq F$ and $C\setminus MCS$ is SAT. Therefore the $MCS$ is transformed into MinCutSet.
